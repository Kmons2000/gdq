        Games Done Quick refers to how the event is based on speedruns of video games.  Speedruns are what people do in video games where they play the game as fast as they possibly can to try to get personal and possibly even world records.  This event goes on for about a week and is on nonstop that entire week. GDQ is also held bi-yearly.  One in winter, which is Awesome Games Done Quick, and one in the summer, which is Summer Games Done Quick.

        GDQ has raised a lot of money towards charity and all profits go to charity.  All the people who play games during this event, also called the runners, do it for no pay just to help raise money for charity.  This event is a great way to bring people together who like video games and raise money for people who are in need at the same time.  GDQ is starting to raise over one million dollars at each event and that is hopefully only going to get larger and larger.
